Markdown Blog
==========================================

You will be creating a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) powered blog engine.

You have two hours to design and build as much as you can. Feel free to leverage any technologies, libraries, frameworks you'd like; in fact we encourage you to use anything that will let you build faster.

After two hours, you will demonstrate the following:
* What you have accomplished
* Your thought process during design and build
* What it would take to finish what you started


Project Requirements
--------------------

* Provide ability to create and modify blog posts as [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
* Blog should have at least two pages:
  * One main page to list titles of available blog posts
  * One to view a specific blog post in its entirety
* Should be easily deployable to the Internet
* Source code must be hosted on github (doesn't have to be public)

#### Bonus points for thinking about:
* Data Storage
* Design/CSS
* Post Metadata

What We're Looking For
----------------------

This is an intentionally ambitious project for the given time; we don't expect you to complete it.

We do expect you to accomplish as much as you can and to learn what it would take to finish it.

We're primarily interested in how you think about technology and code, how you approach large problems, and your ability to dive into new projects face first.

You will be assessed on the following:
* How much you accomplished in the given time
* Ability to design and plan the technical requirements
* Use of existing tools and technologies
* Ability to communicate what you have designed and built


You May...
----------
* Use any programming language(s) you'd like.
* Use the internet freely.
* Ask us any questions you'd like (just interrupt one of us… I suggest Greg).


You May Not...
--------------
* Use a hosted blogging platform, open source or otherwise (Medium, Ghost, Wordpress.com).
* Enlist the help of others outside of the Sendwithus team. (Remember: questions are okay — we don't bite)
* Work outside of Spacestation.
