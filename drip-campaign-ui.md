Drip Campaign UI
================

You will be creating an interactive UI for building a drip campaign.

You have two hours to design and build as much as you can. Feel free to 
leverage any technologies, libraries, frameworks you'd like; in fact we 
encourage you to use anything that will let you build faster.

After two hours, you will demonstrate the following:
* What you have accomplished
* Your thought process during design and build
* What it would take to finish what you started


Project Requirements
--------------------

* Provide the ability to create and modify *steps*
  * A step consists of a time delay and an email template to send
* Must be interactive
  * Create, Update, Delete campaign steps


What We're Looking For
----------------------

This is an intentionally ambitious project for the given time; we don't expect you to complete it.

We do expect you to accomplish as much as you can and to learn what it would take to finish it.

We're primarily interested in how you think about technology and code, how you approach 
large problems, and your ability to dive into new projects face first.

You will be assessed on the following:

* How much you accomplished in the given time
* Ability to design and plan the technical requirements
* Use of existing tools and technologies
* Ability to communicate what you have designed and built


You May...
----------

* Use any languages, libraries, or frameworks you'd like.
* Use the internet freely.
* Ask us any questions you'd like (just interrupt one of us… I suggest Greg).


You May Not...
--------------

* Use a pre-build solution
* Enlist the help of others outside of the Sendwithus team. (Remember: questions are okay — we don't bite)
* Work outside of Spacestation.
