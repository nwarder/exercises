Markdown Blog
=============

You will be creating a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) powered blog engine.

You are responsible for designing and building as much as you can in the allowed time.
Feel free to leverage any technologies, libraries, frameworks you'd like;
in fact we encourage you to use anything that will let you build faster.

After the allowed time, you will demonstrate the following:

* What you have accomplished
* Your thought process during design and build
* What it would take to finish the project

This is an intentionally ambitious project for the given time. __We do not expect you to complete it__.

We do expect you to accomplish as much as you can and to learn what it would take to finish it.


Project Requirements
--------------------

Create a web application for writing and publishing blog posts written in Markdown.

Your web application must...

* Power at least two public pages:
  * One index page listing metadata about published blog posts
  * One to view a specific blog post in its entirety
* Provide the ability to create and modify blog posts.
  * Blog posts must be written and stored as [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
* Be easily deployable to the Internet
* Be hosted on Github and accessible by the Sendwithus team

#### Bonus points for thinking about:

* Data Storage
* Design/CSS
* Post Metadata


What We're Looking For
----------------------

We're primarily interested in how you think about technology and code, how you approach
large problems, and your ability to dive fearlessly into new projects.

You will be assessed on the following:

* How much you accomplish in the given time
* Your ability to design and plan the technical requirements
* Use of existing tools and technologies
* Your ability to communicate and discuss what you have designed and built


You May...
----------
* Use any languages, libraries, or frameworks you'd like
* Use the internet freely
* Ask us any questions you'd like (just interrupt one of us)


You May Not...
--------------
* Use a hosted blogging platform, open source or otherwise (Jekyll, Medium, Ghost, Wordpress.com)
* Enlist the help of others outside of the Sendwithus team. Remember, questions are okay!
* Work outside of the Sendwithus office
