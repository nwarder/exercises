UI Developer
============

You will be reviewing the Sendwithus app and identifying the following...

* UI inconsistencies and confusing UI elements
* opportunities for simple UX and workflow improvements
* proposed solutions for all the above


#### Overview

You are responsible for reviewing the Sendwithus App UI and its workflows, identifying
common inconsistencies and quick UI/UX improvements, and proposing / demonstrating simple solutions.
This task directly mirrors what you'll be doing in the UI Developer role (but on a smaller scale).

After the allowed time, you will demonstrate the following:

* Your thought process during app review and analysis
* What inconsistencies and opportunities for improvement you have identified
* Your proposed solutions and workflows (demos/screenshots/sketches/whatever are great!)
* What would be required to implement your solutions

To be clear, __this is not a design exercise__. We're looking for exceptionally detail-oriented UI development.
You are expected to be capable of implementing all your suggestions to a high level of quality.


Getting Started
---------------

Get started by [creating an account here](https://app.sendwithus.com/signup)
and logging into your account. Typical Sendwithus users get started by [creating a Template](https://www.sendwithus.com/docs/templating) and [making an API call to send an email](https://www.sendwithus.com/docs/api#sending-emails), so that is a good workflow to start with.

If you need help understanding what Sendwithus is or how specific features work, do not hesitate to ask Brad or Dylan for help!


What We're Looking For
----------------------

We're primarily interested in how you think about user interfaces, workflows, and front-end code. We're also looking to learn how you approach large problems, and your ability to dive fearlessly into new projects.

You will be assessed on the following:

* Ability to assess and identify UI improvements
* Rapid iteration and prototyping skills (find quick and creative ways to show us what you're thinking!)
* Ability to communicate and discuss your proposed improvements and implementations


You May...
----------
* Use any languages, libraries, or frameworks you'd like
* Use the internet freely
* Ask us any questions you'd like (just interrupt one of us)


You May Not...
--------------
* Use an existing hosted solution
* Enlist the help of others outside of the Sendwithus team. Remember, questions are okay!
* Work outside of the Sendwithus office
